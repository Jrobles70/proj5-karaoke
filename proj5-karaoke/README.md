# Project 5:  Where's my karaoke
Google Maps API project that allows a user to add points of interest into a text file (located in the data folder) that will display on a map when the page is loaded. Custom markers can be created by clicking the map where you would like the marker. Also the page will show the current location if location services are enabled. There is a delete custom marker button on the bottom that will delete and markers that have been made.

## How to use
```
bash ./configure
make run
```
